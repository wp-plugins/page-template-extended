Create templates for a specific page by its ID. Subpages inherit templates from their parent pages.

== Description ==

Create templates for a specific page by its ID.
The reason I made this plugin, was to have subpages inherit their parent pages template.
If the subpage doesn't have a template assigned, the parent pages template will be used if it exists. It goes all the way up the hierarchy.

The plugin works with an infinite number of subpages. If lets say a subpage is 6 levels down.
It will look at the first parent for the template, if it doesn't exist it will look one level up at the next parent.
So you can assign a template for the first level and fifth level. If you do so, level 1-4 would have the same page template and 5-6 a different page template.

If a template is assigned through the page edit screen, it will overwrite this.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `page-template-extended` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Create a page template in your theme folder (`/themes/theme-name/page-"ID".php`).
